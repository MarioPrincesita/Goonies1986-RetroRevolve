# Our project

Our intention is to to replicate the 1996 The Goonies retro video-game, as a tribute. This project has been done by only two spanish students of CITM - UPC (Barcelona).

The creation of this game involved building it entirely from the ground up using the C++ programming language and exploiting the capabilities of the Raylib library. Sprites and music from the original game were extracted and incorporated into this version. The game encompasses the first 3 stage found in the original game.

The Goonies is a platform game based on the movie in which the player takes the role of Cyclops Fratelli, often shortened to Sloth, who belongs by force to the Fratelli’s (formerly), a notorious family of Italian criminals. Despite his circumstances, he is an ally of the Goonies, a group of friends whose only hope lies in having exciting and powerful adventures.

It is a single-player, side-scrolling, action-adventure platform game that was developed by Konami for the MSX. It combines elements of platforming, puzzle-solving, and exploration, navigating through various levels inspired by scenes from the film, all in an effort to rescue his kidnapped friends and find the treasure of One-Eyed Willy.

It was first released on the Japanese Famicom in 1986 and quickly ported to the Sharp X1, MSX and PC-8801. Its media type was a cartridge, and it supported a keyboard as an input device, and as a controller, a digital joystick.
