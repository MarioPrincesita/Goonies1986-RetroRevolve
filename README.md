              # Goonies1986-RetroRevolve



COSAS POR PONER

- Short description of the game, names and a team photo
- Short description of the main contributions of each team member.
- Embedded gameplay video uploaded on YouTube of 1 or 2 minutes presenting the project's purpose
and context (screenshot with UPC logo, team members, “this project is a tribute to”, …), the gameplay
(with captions presenting the features, win condition, lose condition, items, enemies…) and the
debugging features (colliders, lines, areas…).
This video can be a good reference: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqicyGE5C4k (it is still missing
some more gameplay, though)
